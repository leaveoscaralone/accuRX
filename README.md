## Task

For this task, we would like you to create a dashboard for a GP practice. The dashboard will help doctors and admin staff to see at a glance which patients have had which COVID-19 vaccine.

## Tech

You can use **vanilla JS or any front-end framework and tools** you wish to create the following project. (For your reference, we use React)

## Patient Data API Endpoint

Patient data can be accessed using the following endpoint: [[https://61ba219448df2f0017e5a929.mockapi.io/api/patients](https://61ba219448df2f0017e5a929.mockapi.io/api/patients)]

# Instructions:
1️. Please present the following patient data to the end user:
- Patient’s first and last name.
- Vaccine application date.
- The type of vaccine the patient had.    
2. Make the data sortable by the patient's last name, alphabetically in ascending and descending order.
3. Create a search box which automatically filters the list of results based on patient names. The filtering should occur after the user has entered the first two characters.

# To run application: 
- `cd client`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` (Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in your browser)
- `npm test` (runs tests)
